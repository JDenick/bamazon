When the letter "M" is entered as instructed, you then will be exited from the app


Customer 8:
When you chose a quantity that is not available, you will get an error message saying "insufficient inventory" and to try to make a different purchase. 

From the example, I tried to purchase 100 Basketballs which didn't let me purchase them. 


Customer 9:
When you choose a product that is not avaialble, you would receive an error message stating that "it is not a valid selection" and will then prompt you to make another selection.

In the example, I tried entering something random and it wouldn't let me continue forward until I entered a valid selection.
